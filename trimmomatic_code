# Script for running multiple Trimmomatic processes in the background

# *****Dependent on the amount of CPU you have****

# Create a directory with the Illumina Adapters with nano
# nano Illumina_Adapters.fasta
# >IlluminaAdapterSeq1
# AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
# >IlluminaAdapterSeq2
# AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT

# You can run one loop running per CPU you have. If you are limited by the amount of CPU you will have to adjust the [     ]*_R1_*.fastq.gz command to limit the amount of loops

for filename in *_R1_*.fastq.gz
do
# first, make the base by removing fastq.gz
  base=$(basename $filename .fastq.gz)
  echo $base
        
# now, construct the R2 filename by replacing R1 with R2
  baseR2=${base/_R1_/_R2_}
  echo $baseR2
        
# finally, run Trimmomatic
